              After spending 7 wonderful years in the fitness and health
              industry, I felt the urge to explore new avenues. I wanted to be
              part of something big that allowed me to utilize my skills in
              building and design. It was then that I discovered the world of
              front-end development and it was an instant love affair! I'm
              thoroughly enjoying every moment of this exciting new journey.

            I was the owner of a gym where I conducted extensive market
            analysis, focusing on both current and future trends. I also
            analyzed customer behavior and needs to ensure that we were
            providing the best possible service. In addition to these
            responsibilities, I was in charge of budgeting and financial
            management.

            My role involved assisting individuals in achieving their health

            presumptions, and goals. By carefully considering each of these
            factors, I was able to develop personalized plans that helped my

            I was employed at a rehabilitation center for young people with a
